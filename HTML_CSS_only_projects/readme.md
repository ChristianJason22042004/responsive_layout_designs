⚡ How It Works

Card Layout

The card displays location, date, temperature, and unit (Celsius).

Designed with flexbox alignment for clean positioning.

Visual Elements

The sun and clouds are created with CSS shapes, positioned at the top-right.

Temperature is emphasized with large typography for quick readability.

Animations & Transforms

On hover, the card uses a CSS transform (scale & translateY) to “lift” off the background.

A box-shadow transition enhances the floating effect.

The gradient background subtly shifts for a dynamic, smooth look.

Responsiveness

On desktop, the card has spacious padding and shadow depth.

On mobile, the layout adjusts with optimized font sizes and spacing.
